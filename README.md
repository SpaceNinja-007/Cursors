# Cursors
A pile of windows cursors

## How to use

Right now, you have to go into the zip folder, click "View Raw," then extract the folder. After that, move the unzipped folder to a known location so you can access it easily.

## Notes

Some of our older cursors are not well made and might look bad.

## Tips

- Keep your cursors organized in a dedicated folder for easy access.
- Test new cursors before setting them as default to make sure they look good.
- Backup your original Windows cursors before replacing them.
